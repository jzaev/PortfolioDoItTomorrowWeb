# Simple task organizer

This version is made for practicing programming in Python and for a professional portfolio
by <a href="https://github.com/jzaev" target="_blank">Yury Zaev</a>. It does not represent any commercial interest and
is not a complete solution.

## Features

This is a simple management web application designed to help you stay organized. The main feature is that all incomplete tasks are automatically moved to today, they don't go into the past like in other programs and it's impossible to lose them. Also you can:

* Create and delete tasks. 

* Organize your tasks into separate lists for today and tomorrow.

* Mark tasks as completed and watch them.

* Move tasks between today and tomorrow.
